## About

This project is a GitHub template repository designed to streamline the creation of NuGet packages. By leveraging this
template, you can quickly set up a new repository with the essential structure and files needed for developing and
distributing a NuGet package.

The template includes:

- A pre-configured project structure optimized for NuGet package development.
- Sample code and tests to help you get started quickly.
- Continuous Integration (CI) workflows for automated building and testing.

Whether you are building libraries, tools, or other reusable components, this template provides a solid foundation to
help you focus on developing great software without worrying about the initial setup.
